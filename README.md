The main aim of the project is the management of the database of ART GALLERY. This project is insight into the design and implementation of a Art Gallery Management. This is done by creating a database of the available details in Art Gallery. The primary aim of this Art Gallery Management System is to improve accuracy and enhance safety and efficiency of tracking and keeping details of art and paintings in art gallery. I have developed this software for ensuring effective policing by providing statistics of the Members. The MYSQL database is used as a platform along with PHP and WAMP Server support.
